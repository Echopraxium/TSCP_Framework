- Status: Phase 1 Foundation Validated
- Success Metric: 23 triples ingested without URI errors.

## 2. DOCUMENTATION STACK (docs/)
The following documents must be provided as reference to any new session agent:

- REBOOT_PHASE_2.md: Immediate tactical state and next tasks.
- RESEARCH_DRAFT_V0.md: Scientific ambition and transdisciplinary goals.
- Systemic_Architect_Companion_Guide.md: Formal mathematical foundations (Tensor Algebra).
- README.md: Development standards, language rules (English only), and stylistic constraints (No smileys).

## 3. TECHNICAL ARTEFACTS
- snapshot_v1.jsonld: The semantic state of the graph.
- technical_safe.txt: Build commands and URI fallback documentation.
- Loader.fs: Crucial code for manual ontology injection.
- Program.fs: The CLI loop and command definitions.

## 4. ARCHIVING PROTOCOL
Prior to Phase 2 launch, the current state is archived at:
